Roller Derby Skills Grader v1.1

This is a simple Ruby on Rails web app built to give users a way to log in and keep track of their skill level in various roller derby skills, such as knowledge of rulebook, footwork, strategy, and general skills.

Users sign up and add skills to their profile. Users can choose a display name (usually their derby name), an alternate name (their legal name), their league affiliation, and their user type (blocker, jammer, freshmeat, ref, nso, or a combination of any). Skills have a skill name, a level (on a scale of 1-5), and comments.

Currently all user profiles are private (except to admin). Setting up user roles so that a coach/moderator user role can be defined for coaches to keep track of their players.
